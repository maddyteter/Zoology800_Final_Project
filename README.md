# Zoology800_Final_Project

#The first code script to run would be the "bootstrap_decomp_code". 
#This script contains the code that bootstraps k values 

#The next script to load is "Zoology_800_Mteter_Final_Code_1"
#This has all of my environmental variables (a lot of lines of code) that allows
#for comparison between environmental variables and my true k values (single value
#per site position - not bootstrapped)
